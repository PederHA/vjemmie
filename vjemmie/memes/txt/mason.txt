DOTA ALL STAR MASON MADE HIS SPLASH ON THE COMPETITIVE SCENE BY SHITTING ON KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN MAKING PENNIES FOR YEARS WHILE HE STROLLED IN AND WON MULTIPLE TOURNAMENTS AND MADE FAT STACKS.

WIDELY REGARDED AS THE BEST PROFESSIONAL DOTA 2 PLAYER IN THE SCENE BY HIS PEERS AND FANS, MASON REMAINS HUMBLE AND EAGER TO LEARN. EVEN THOUGH HE NO LONGER PLAYS, HE STILL HAS IMMENSE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE GAME SERIOUSLY.

NOW LIVING A LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE REMOVED FROM THE DOTA SCENE, MASON ENJOYS SPENDING HIS TIME READING BOOKS, WALKING HIS DOG, AND MAKING LOVE TO HIS BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND.
