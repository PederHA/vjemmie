What the fuck did you just say about me, you fucking little turk? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my raid in Black Rock Foundry, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Oregorger, and I have over 300 confirmed deaths. I am trained in dying on movement fights and I’m the top dps whore on the Bloodfeather-EU server. You are nothing to me but just another train on Thogar. I will wipe your raid the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Azeroth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with killing a boss without me dying to basic mechanics? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of warlocks across the server and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the wellwellwell, maggot. The wellwellwell that deafens you on teamspeak and wipes out any hope of you killing a boss this raid. Know your place, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can die to Oregorger's roll in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just on Mythic. Not only am I extensively trained in being dead most of the fight, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the standing in clouds on Tectus and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable raid off the face of the Azeroth, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” world rank was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have let me drag down the raid team again. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re 700 world ranks higher, you goddamn idiot. I will manipulate the loot distribution and you will be 20 item levels lower than me. Give us the other 20%, kiddo
